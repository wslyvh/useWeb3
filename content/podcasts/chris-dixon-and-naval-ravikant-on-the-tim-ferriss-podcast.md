“What the smartest people do on the weekends is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years.”
— Chris Dixon

“Denying and pushing back against NFTs and crypto is basically saying: ‘We’re not going to have a collectively owned future. We’re going to have a corporate-owned future, and we’re going to have a government-owned future.'”
— Naval Ravikant
