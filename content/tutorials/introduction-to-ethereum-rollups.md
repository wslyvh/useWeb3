Ethereum, the most popular blockchain, has seen scaling issues for quite a long time now. With high gas fees due to congestion being the primary pain point. With the increasing cost to use the network, a plethora of scaling solutions have emerged. Today in this guide, we will go over some Ethereum scaling solutions and deep dive into rollups.

Ethereum Scaling solutions
The main goal of all the Ethereum scaling solutions is to increase transaction speed and throughput without compromising the decentralized nature of the blockchain.

There are two main directions in which these scaling solutions are being explored:
- On-chain Scaling
- Off-chain Scaling
