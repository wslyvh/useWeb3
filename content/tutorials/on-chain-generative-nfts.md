buddy buddy tag NFTs are a brand new project put together to experiment with completely on-chain generative development. you get one for yourself, for your friend, forever😹. as of this point, there are 13 minted tags, with 7 of them confirmed!

What does that mean? well, buddy buddy tags are on-chain, generative NFTs that require a minter to submit a buddy’s address when minting. the minter receives a randomized set of emojis along with his wallet address and his buddies. think of it like a fortune cookie, you don’t know what you’ll draw, and the interpretation is up to the minter and his buddy.
