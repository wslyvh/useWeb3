This monorepo will help you get started with building on Arbitrum. It provides various simple demos showing and explaining how to interact with Arbitrum â€” deploying and using contracts directly on L2, moving Ether and tokens betweens L1 and L2, and more.

We show how you can use broadly supported Ethereum ecosystem tooling (Hardhat, Ethers-js, etc.) as well as our special arb-ts library for convenience.
