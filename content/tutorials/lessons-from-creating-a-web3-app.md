I'd been hearing a lot about Web3 and reluctantly did a deep dive on it over the weekend. What really caught my eye is the idea of decentralizing the control and ownership that currently only a few companies have.

In the Web3 world, this wouldn't happen because of the decentralized nature of Web3 applications, no single entity on the network can block anyone from submitting transactions, taking away control to dictate what is and isn't allowed away from payment processors and the entities that govern them.
