If you want maximum arbitrage performance, you need to swap tokens between exchanges in a single transaction. Or maybe you just want to save gas on certain swaps you perform regularly. Or maybe you have your own custom use case for swapping between decentralized exchanges. And of course maybe you are just here for the learning aspect.
