Using the project’s code base and test frameworks for trying exploits, written as unit tests.

This method has a few advantages:
- Sometimes contracts are deployed, but there isn’t solid info on finding them. Using the development team’s code base makes things easier because you don’t have to interact with deployed contracts.
- You can easily test contracts that are in scope for the bounties but haven’t been deployed yet. Forking the mainnet wouldn’t help you here.
- Sometimes project code bases already have tons of tests and scenarios ready. You just need to tweak a few lines of a unit test to test an exploit.
- Project development teams are familiar with their unit tests. A new unit test using the same practices is easier for them to validate than a stand-alone PoC (proof of concept).

Being able to quickly modify an existing test and check if an exploit works is a valuable asset to have in your toolkit.
