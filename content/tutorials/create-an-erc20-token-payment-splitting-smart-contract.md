Payments are a reoccurring topic across pretty much every area of crypto, specifically providing payments to multiple stakeholders. For instance, a DAO wants to provide funding to multiple initiatives, a DEX want to consolidate and distribute trading fees to certain participants, or a team wants to distribute tokens to team members as a monthly paycheck.

Smart contracts allow us to automate these type of payment functions, which limits potential mistakes caused by manually managing payments and allows us to spend our valuable time on other productive tasks.
