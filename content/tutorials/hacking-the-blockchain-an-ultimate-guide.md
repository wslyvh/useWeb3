I remember watching the events of the Poly Network hack and being at a loss for words. My mind began to fire off on all cylinders trying to piece together how it had happened. Blockchain-related hacks were quite common by this time, but this was one of the first that had made its way to my ears. And although the hacker returned the funds, the event itself was wild enough to be memorable, to spark my curiosity, and to set me on the path to become a hacker…again.

Blockchain hacking is one of the more elusive paths in cybersecurity, but taking it remains one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. It’s groundbreaking, challenging, and extremely rewarding, both intellectually and financially. I’ve had to get knee deep into the intricacies of how things work — something I didn’t do in other disciplines. Smart contract hacking is a form of art, and there’s nothing more beautiful than watching an exploit and the series of transactions that follow.

Being a whitehat hacker in the Web3 space feels a lot like being a superhero. Nothing beats the elation that comes from saving the common man millions of dollars, especially because many are just trying to get by in a system designed to fail them. The financial benefits that come from being at the forefront of technological breakthroughs aren’t bad, either. Bug bounties of up to 2.5 million USD are being paid out for critical bugs, and the average yearly salary at a blockchain security firm is $150,000.

To top it off, most of these opportunities are fully remote, meaning you can work from home.
