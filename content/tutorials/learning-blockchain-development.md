I was recently asked in an online forum for my recommendations on resources for developers looking to learn blockchain development, and I started writing an answer, but it sort of kept on going and going. The results are the article in front of you.

This isn’t an article about the advantages and disadvantages of building on a blockchain. It’s just a guide about the things  you’ll need to learn once you’ve decided to learn blockchain, and what the steps of making a blockchain application look like. Not everything should be on a blockchain.

There are a lot of different resources out there, and as with any tech stack choices, things can get opinionated. There is still a need, especially with regards newcomers in the field, to direct to the right tools. I'll try to find a middle ground in between my opinions and a general list.
