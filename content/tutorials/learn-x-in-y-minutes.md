Solidity lets you program on Ethereum, a blockchain-based virtual machine that allows the creation and execution of smart contracts, without requiring centralized or trusted parties.

Solidity is a statically typed, contract programming language that has similarities to Javascript and C. Like objects in OOP, each contract contains state variables, functions, and common data types. Contract-specific features include modifier (guard) clauses, event notifiers for listeners, and custom global variables.

Some Ethereum contract examples include crowdfunding, voting, decentralized finance, and blind auctions.
