I recently joined Edge & Node as a Developer Relations Engineer and have been diving deeper into smart contract development with Ethereum. I have settled upon what I think is the best stack for building full stack dApps with Solidity:

▶︎ Client Framework - React
▶︎ Ethereum development environment - Hardhat
▶︎ Ethereum Web Client Library - Ethers.js
▶︎ API layer - The Graph Protocol
