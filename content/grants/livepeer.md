Livepeer has a long term vision to build a fully decentralized video stack, and we cannot achieve this goal without a community of contributors to the project. Livepeer Grants provides funding to projects, ideas and events that benefit the Livepeer ecosystem. The grants program provides contributors with an opportunity to fund their projects and build a position in the Livepeer network. Livepeer Grants aims to distribute upto $250,000 in grants each quarter with semi annual review phases.
