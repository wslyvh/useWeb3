We launched this effort with a focus on enabling the entire user base, with its wide range of talents, to contribute those skills to the protocol in their own ways-whatever those ways are! Our approach to achieving that goal is to offer users the option to apply for Micro Grants in addition to proposals that require much more attention. These will serve as the on-ramp for the less involved, smaller budget proposals in an effort to be accessible by the entire userbase.
