What does it mean to own a piece of the internet? Can you sell a meme to the highest bidder? Is the metaverse finally happening? Let's find out together!

Welcome to NFT School, a collective of web developers and technology enthusiasts here to figure out what's going on with non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. In the past few years, NFTs have gone from a niche concern within the blockchain world to a cultural phenomenon that has captured the imagination of artists, technologists, and the mass media.

As builders, we'll be exploring NFTs from the technical side, taking them apart, and seeing how they work. We'll also take a look at some of the use cases for NFTs, so that we can help build new experiences around them.

We'll be building on a background of modern web development, with a focus on JavaScript. Along the way, we'll get familiar with the core technologies that make NFTs possible, like smart contracts and content-addressed storage. If you're a newcomer to the space and find yourself confused, we want to know about it! Please open an issue (opens new window)with any suggestions for how to make this content more accessible.
