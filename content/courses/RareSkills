We are the go to resource for advanced web3 and blockchain knowledge. Our core solidity curriculum lasts 16 weeks and focuses on security, EVM and gas optimization, design patterns, and applied cryptography. We primarily admit students who have previous blockchain experience, but exceptional and experienced developers can be admitted also. Our extended curriculum includes topics like DeFi and Zero Knowledge Proofs.
