In October 2016, the Berkeley Bitcoin Association, a group of about a dozen members, founded Blockchain at Berkeley, an organization dedicated to becoming the blockchain hub of the East Bay. They also debuted the world’s first undergraduate university-accredited blockchain course, Blockchain Fundamentals, taught to about 50 students. Alongside Blockchain at Berkeley’s education team grew a consultancy that aimed to bridge the gap between geeky bitcoin enthusiasts and technovative early-adopters in the industry to develop Proof-of-Concepts for disruptive blockchain use cases. Since then, as a result of other ambitious B@B members, R&D and Design departments have also emerged.
