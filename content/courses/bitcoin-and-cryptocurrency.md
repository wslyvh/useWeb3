To really understand what's so special about Bitcoin, we need to understand how it works on a technical level. We will look at the important questions about Bitcoin, such as: How does Bitcoin work? What makes Bitcoin different? How secure are your Bitcoins? How anonymous are Bitcoin users? What determines the price of bitcoins? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? What could the future hold? After this course, you will know everything you need to distinguish fact from fiction when it comes to claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You will have the conceptual foundations you need to develop secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And you will be able to integrate ideas from Bitcoin into your own projects.
