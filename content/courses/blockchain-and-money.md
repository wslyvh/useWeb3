This course is for students wishing to explore blockchain technology’s potential use—by entrepreneurs & incumbents—to change the world of money and finance.

Kicking off with a review of the technology’s initial application, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, students will gain an understanding of the commercial, technical and public policy fundamentals of blockchain technology, distributed ledgers and smart contracts in both open sourced and private applications.

The class will then turn to current and potential blockchain applications in the financial sector. This will include reviews of potential use cases for payment systems, central banking, venture  capital, secondary market trading, trade finance, commercial banking, post trade possessing and digital ID.

Along the way, we will explore the markets and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings, other tokens and crypto derivatives.
