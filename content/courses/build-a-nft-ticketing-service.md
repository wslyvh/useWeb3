NFTs, non-fungible tokens, have taken the online world by storm ushering in the proclamation of a new world-wide web... web3.

For most, NFTs mean profile pictures (pfps). üêµ

This isn't the most practical use case, even if it is a lot of fun

Even if you wanted to create useful NFTs, it‚Äôs not easy to get started.

Since the tooling is still being developed, it can be confusing as to where to get started. It also doesn't help that there's a paradigm shift with app development from web2 to web3.

Here be dragons üêâ

This course is here to get you through that initial learning curve and frustrating lack of answered questions and good documentation.

Through building this project you will learn the general development lifecycle of NFT smart contracts and dApps giving you the skills to start your own projects.

By the end of this course, you will be able to do the following

- Use the OpenZeppelin Solidity library to create NFT smart-contracts
- Deploy smart contracts to Ethereum testnets
- Host static assets on IFPS
- Create a React dApp that interacts with your smart-contract API
- Confirm a wallet owns an NFT
