If you are new to blockchain development and don’t know where to start, or if you just want to understand how to deploy and interact with smart contracts, this guide is for you. We will walk through creating and deploying a simple smart contract on the Ropsten test network using a virtual wallet (Metamask), Solidity, Hardhat and Truffle, and Alchemy (don’t worry if you don’t understand what any of this means yet, we will explain it!).
