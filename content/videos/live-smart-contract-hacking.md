In this video you can see me working over 10h on hacking an Ethereum smart contract. The attack was done on a private chain, so no actual Ethereum users have been affected.

This was a challenge called `Montagy` from the Real World CTF 2019 competition.

Even though this was part of a competition, the methodology and technologies used are the tools used in real-life Ethereum hacking as well.
