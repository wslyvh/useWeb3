This tutorial walks through three integration scenarios for implementing social logins (via Particle Network) within an application. Specifically, this 12-minute video dives into using Particle Auth, Particle Connect, and Particle Network's `wallet-adapter` integration on Solana. Each of these mechanisms use MPC-TSS to onboard a user within a secure wallet derived from social login, such as Google, Twitter, email, GitHub, etc.
