In this video you’ll learn how to build a modern full stack dApp on the Ethereum blockchain with React, Solidity, Hardhat, and Ethers.js. We’ll start from scratch, creating a React application, installing the dependencies, and initializing a new local Hardhat Ethereum environment.

Next, we’ll create a couple of different smart contracts in Solidity, compile them, and deploy them to a local blockchain node that we will also initialize using Hardhat. We’ll then learn how to deploy the smart contracts to a real live test network.

We’ll then connect the React front end to allow users to read data from the blockchain as well as create transactions with MetaMask using test Ether that we create using accounts created by our local test environment.

Finally, we’ll learn how to create and mint real ERC20 tokens, as well as how to rapidly prototype smart contracts using the Remix IDE.

By the end of this guide, you should have a good understanding of how to build modern dApps with React and Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain.
