A great set of tools allowing all devs to dive deep into smart contracts (either for learning or prod-level debugging), simulate both individual transactions and complex scenarios with real-time on-chain data, monitor any entity and create full-fledged serverless DeFi solutions. Oh, and it's all available in the free plan :)
