First setup using Nile which makes managing files and command line calls to StarkNet simple.
Second have a look at how pytest works
After you have set everything up, to run the examples:
- Open two terminals in the project folder and run source env/bin/activate
- In one run nile node to start a local devnet.
- In the other run the commands in the examples.
