This is a collection of templates based on popular smart contracts like CoolCatsNFT and Loot.

Each contract is unique, addressing different aspects and mechanisms of the smart contract. Accompanying the contract is a detailed breakdown of how the contract is written and hardhat deployment scripts.

New contracts and breakdown are published every week.
