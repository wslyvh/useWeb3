This boilerplate repository provides a simple mechanism for implementing social login options within a RainbowKit modal, creating a familiar environment for users to onboard with their Google account, email, Twitter, phone, etc.

Specifically, this uses Particle Auth (an service from Particle Network) to generate a wallet derived from the social login process, secured using MPC-TSS.

This boilerplate is written in TypeScript and uses RainbowKit (alongside the Particle RainbowKit extension), Wagmi, TypeScript, and Particle Auth.
