Particle Auth Core facilitates social logins (through Google, email, Twitter, phone, etc.), onboarding users into either EOA or AA accounts secured by MPC-TSS. This boilerplate acts as a starting point and full demo for implementing Particle Auth Core to achieve this, specifically in-tandem with ERC-4337 account abstraction.

Built using Particle Auth Core, TypeScript, Particle AA SDK.
