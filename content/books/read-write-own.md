A potent exploration of the power of blockchains to reshape the future of the Internet — and how that affects us all—from highly influential entrepreneur and technology investor Chris Dixon.

The author's thesis is that seemingly small initial decisions around software and network design can have profound downstream consequences on the control and economics of digital services. The book walks through the history of the internet, showing how it has gone through three major design eras: the first focused on democratizing information (read), the second on democratizing publishing (write), and the third on democratizing ownership (own).
