In non-technical terms, this book explains Digital Con-tracts: legally enforceable smart contracts that anyone can read.

You do NOT need prior knowledge about blockchains.

The book outlines the concept, gives examples, provides links to online tools that help to write, sign, deploy and manage digital contracts on the blockchain. Lexon’s grammar, vocabulary and document structure are illustrated. Lex-on's paradigm is explained, including how it differs from other programming languages, staying closer to human thought. Lexon’s relationship to Computational Law and AI is discussed and applications and benefits are detailed. The appendix lists notable steps towards human-readability by other programming languages, complemented with notes on constructed human languages.
