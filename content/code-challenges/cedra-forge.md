#### ⚙️ Track 3: Developer Tools
Enhance the developer experience by building tools that make working with Cedra easier and more efficient. Consider creating SDK libraries and wrappers in various programming languages, CLI tools for automation and deployment, testing frameworks and utilities for Move contracts, or IDE plugins and extensions that improve the development workflow.

### 1. Build Your Project
Create something original that showcases Move's capabilities and addresses real needs in the blockchain space. Your project should demonstrate innovation, whether through novel smart contract design, unique educational approaches, or tools that solve genuine developer pain points.
